# Hot-Restaurant-App
A Full Stack application developed during a 3 hours class. We were paired in teams of 4. Two people worked on the front end while the other 2 developed the back end. Towards the end of class, we brought the code together. This application does not make use of a MySQL database. Given the short amount of time provided, we used a local array instead to simulate a database.
